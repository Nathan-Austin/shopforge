# Roadmap

Planned work for shopforge, roughly in order.

## 1. Storefront and orders

- [ ] Cart and add-to-cart
- [ ] Product detail page
- [ ] Orders tables and Stripe webhook, so paid checkouts are recorded
- [ ] Order confirmation email
- [ ] Admin orders view

## 2. Admin and store settings

- [ ] Categories and brands admin
- [ ] Store settings (currency, shipping zones) in the database, replacing the
      hardcoded `src/lib/shipping/config.ts`
- [ ] Admin UI for `src/lib/products/config.ts`: tick which product fields the
      shop manages, without editing the file. The columns already all exist,
      so this needs no migration
- [ ] Admin UI for the heat scale: rename or drop the word bands and switch
      how heat appears in the shop (word and number, word only, number only,
      chilli icons). `HEAT_SCALE.display` already drives `formatHeat`
- [ ] Theme tokens instead of hardcoded colours

## 3. Languages

- [ ] Full `de`, `tr` and `ar` translations

## 4. Generator

- [x] Fix the first `pnpm add` failing on pnpm 11 with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`
      (new build scripts need approving in `allowBuilds`) — done 2026-11-02
- [x] Fix the existing `tsc` errors in a generated `generic` store: missing
      `createClient` export in `lib/supabase/client`, missing `@/types/supabase`,
      `ProductForm` default import, `ProductCard` `locale` prop, joined `products`
      typed as an array (admin product page, checkout route), `stripe` not installed
      — done 2026-11-02; a fresh generic store passes install, `tsc`, `lint` and `build`
- [x] `--skip-supabase` flag and `test/generate-and-check.sh` to generate and
      build a store without a Supabase project — done 2026-11-02
- [x] Make a fresh `chilli` store pass the same checks — done 2026-11-02;
      `tsc`, `lint` and `build` are all clean. Fixed: the ProductForm props
      mismatch (now FormData-based like generic), the missing `Chip`
      component, `ProductCard`'s `locale` prop, `BrandCard`'s `heatColor`
      signature, joined rows read via `one()`, and the chilli types
      multi-select, whose absence made `updateProduct` wipe a product's
      chilli types on every save
- [ ] Node CLI replacing the heredocs in the shell scripts
- [ ] Docker self-hosting path alongside Vercel
- [ ] Payment adapters: Stripe, Mollie, PayPal

## 5. CI

- [ ] CI that generates a store and builds it: run
      `test/generate-and-check.sh --mode=generic` and `--mode=chilli` (needs
      Node, pnpm and python3; no Supabase project required)

## Notes for future turns

Decided on 2026-11-02:

- Product fields are chosen at generation time but **every column always
  exists** in the schema. `src/lib/products/config.ts` only says which ones
  the admin uses, so switching one on later never needs a migration. The same
  file holds the heat scale, which is why the planned admin UI for both is
  cheap to build.
- Heat is stored as a **number**, never a word. Words are display bands in
  `HEAT_SCALE.bands` and every one is optional, so a shop can use three words
  or none. Seed heat values live in `seeds.sql` as `__HEAT_n__` on a 0-10
  basis and the generator rescales them.

- `middleware.ts` renamed to `src/proxy.ts` for Next 16. **With `--src-dir`
  the file must be in `src/`**: a `proxy.ts` in the project root is ignored
  silently, with no build warning, which leaves the store with no locale
  routing (`middleware.ts` did work at the root). `test/generate-and-check.sh`
  now fails if the build output has no `Proxy (Middleware)` line.
- `autoprefixer` and `postcss` dropped from the dev dependencies: Tailwind 4
  goes through `@tailwindcss/turbopack` and there is no `postcss.config`.
- `cacheComponents` and `partialPrefetching` stay **off**. create-next-app
  enables both, but every generated page reads cookies or the Supabase
  session, so each needs a Suspense boundary and `export const dynamic =
  'force-dynamic'` removed first. Revisit once the real storefront pages
  exist and there is something worth caching.

**Known gaps in the generated store (not build failures):**

- The storefront doesn't read most of the new product fields yet: `/shop` and
  the product page are still placeholders, so headline, gallery, tags, stock
  and the rest are saved but only visible in the admin. Wire them in with the
  storefront work in section 1.
- `track_inventory` and `allow_backorder` are stored but nothing enforces
  them: checkout doesn't check stock before creating a Stripe session.
- Money is entered in major units and stored as cents everywhere, but the
  currency is per product and free text. A store-level currency belongs with
  the store settings work above.
- `pnpm build` only warns, not fails, when Tailwind isn't wired in. Check the
  build log for "Unknown at rule: @theme" if styles ever disappear again.
- Next 16 does not run ESLint during `next build`; `pnpm lint` is a separate
  step (the test script runs it).
- create-next-app pins `@types/node@^20` and the eslint 9 line (deprecated
  upstream); both are its own choices and harmless today.
